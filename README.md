# GRYFF SVN
This program is extremely useful for GRF management and migration. You can easily open a GRF and extract specific contents via a tree-list view. You can also convert the text type of your files to korean characters with a simple click.

This program was designed by Rasqual Twilight and was originally released for free to the eA community (still is free to use). This upload is merely to preserve this wonderful tool.

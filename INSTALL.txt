Build requirements
------------------
Microsft Visual C++ .NET 2002, 2003, or later [with ATL]
WTL 7.x  (http://wtl.sourceforge.net) - Latest is recommended.
optional: libgrf dll (http://gryff.ragnarok-online.info/?act=grfdll or,
  more generic, http://openkore.sourceforge.net/grftool/ )
  The provided DLL was built against MSVCRT 7.1
optional: zlib (http://zlib.net/) is built as a static lib against MSVCRT 7.1

Patching
--------
gryff uses a modified version of the WTL::CFileDialogImpl class, which
is defined in <atldlgs.h>; a patch has been provided in the utils/ directory.
It comes with no warranty of correctness; also, the program may compile
without patching, by replacing all occurences of CFileDialogImpl<T, true>
to CFileDialogImpl<T>.
However, you won't be able to see the places sidebar in the common
open file dialog.
* Another patch has been issued to fix a crash occuring when you close
a background MDI child frame. The bug lies in the definition of 
WTL::CCommandBarCtrlImpl::OnCreate in <atlctrlw.h>; a patch has been provided
as well. A supplemental resource describing the problem is this post
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wtl/message/10639) on the WTL mailing list.

Instructions
------------
Open the Solution workspace into the Visual Studio IDE.
Add the WTL include dir to your list of include directories.
Select the configuration (Debug or Release).
Build the project.
The resulting executable is placed in src/output.
You may copy it anywhere and associate the .grf and .gpf extensions
to this program.
